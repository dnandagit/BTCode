All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the items
All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast
---The Quality of an item is never negative
"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets
----The Quality of an item is never more than 50
"Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
"Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but
Quality drops to 0 after the concert
We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. This requires an update to our system:

"Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

==============================================================================
quality (min=0)
quality (max=50)
----> All products quality decrease 1 eachday till sellInDate=0 --> then 2X
---->"Aged Brie" actually increases in Quality the older it gets --> No clarity on how it behaves after sellin->assuming increase 1X after 
--->"Backstage passes", like aged brie, increases in Quality as its SellIn value approaches;
			-> 2x+ when there are < 10 and >5 days 
			-> 3x+ when < 5 days 
			-> 0 when day=0 
----->"Sulfuras", being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
to add
----->Conjured" items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items 
	  Assuming decrease 2x eachday till sellInDate=0 --> then 4X(twice as fast)
